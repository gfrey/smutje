# Resource: SmartOS iPXE Server [ipxe]

The host is assumed to be a Raspbian wheezy based rPI!

This host offers DHCP and especially serves an iPXE file to the requiring hosts
thereby making updates pretty easy (just update the `SMARTOS_VERSION`
attribute).

Please note that TFTP is only used to serve the iPXE file. Everything else is
sent out by the nginx configured, too. This is as HTTP is much faster than TFTP
and this is serving pretty big files.

> Address: 172.19.1.254
> Username: pi

> SMARTOS_VERSION: 20160218T022556Z


## Include: rpi.smd [rpi]

The basic Raspbian configuration.


## Package: Network Setup [net]

The host must have a static IP as it should serve as DHCP server. So we give it
the venerable `172.19.1.254`.

    grep "interface eth0" /etc/dhcpcd.conf || cat <<-EOF >> /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    	# Static IP for the eth0 interface
    	interface eth0
    	static ip_address=172.19.1.254/24
    	static routers=172.19.1.1
    	static domain_name_servers=172.19.1.1
    EOF


## Package: TFTP [tftp]

The TFTP server is required to deliver the files.

    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y tftpd
    mkdir -p /srv/tftp

Write the iPXE stuff to the tftp server.

    :write_file ipxe/undionly.kpxe /srv/tftp/undionly.kpxe

    :write_template ipxe/menu.ipxe /srv/tftp/menu.ipxe

Now download and extract the given platform release from SmartOS.

    cd /srv/tftp
    export SmartOS_VERSION="{{ .SMARTOS_VERSION }}"
    export RELEASE_URL=https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/Joyent_Dev/public/builds/smartos/release-${SmartOS_VERSION:0:8}-${SmartOS_VERSION}/smartos
    curl -sSO ${RELEASE_URL}/platform-${SmartOS_VERSION}.tgz
    # curl -sS ${RELEASE_URL}/md5sums.txt | grep tgz | md5sum -c -

    cd /srv/tftp
    tar xvfz platform-{{ .SMARTOS_VERSION }}.tgz
    mkdir -p smartos/{{ .SMARTOS_VERSION }}
    mv platform-{{ .SMARTOS_VERSION }} smartos/{{ .SMARTOS_VERSION }}/platform

    rm -f /srv/tftp/*.tgz


## Package: DHCPD [dhcpd]

The DHCP server is installed and configured to serve IPs and the iPXE boot
file.

    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y isc-dhcp-server

    :write_file ipxe/dhcpd.conf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf


## Package: NGinx [nginx]

The Nginx is installed and configured to also serve the TFTP srv directory, as
the HTTP protocol is much faster than TFTP.

    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y nginx
    rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

    :write_file ipxe/nginx_ipxe_files /etc/nginx/sites-available/ipxe_files

    ln -fs /etc/nginx/sites-available/ipxe_files /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ipxe_files
    nginx -t && /etc/init.d/nginx restart
